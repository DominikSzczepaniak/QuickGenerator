# Random generator that allows you to customize multiple draws

What does it offer:
1. You can create many categories with items and draw them all at the same time
2. You can make conditional draws based on previous ones
3. You can create your account and save your draws setups

Let's look at an example. Consider such scenario - you are planning a date and you have many choices, yet you don't know which one to pick because all of them sounds fun. You can use this generator. How would setup look:
1. Lets create first category - place. 
We can put there cinema, local park, bowling, fancy restaurant, art gallery, escape room. 
Now let's say you want escape room more than anything else, so you would decide to increase chance of it. Then you can just put escape room twice so it will have more chance to be picked during a drawing. 

This scenario is easily doable with any number random generator. But what if you want escape room the most, then bowling then art gallery and cinema and fancy restaurant are ok, but meh. You then assign 5 slots to escape room, 4 to bowling, 3 to art galerry, and 1 to cinema and fancy restaurant. Generating numbers are still going to work there, but will you really remember it all when there will be more categories?

In this app you can just choose for every item whether you want to put it more times than one or just choose a probability.

2. Okay, now let's say you drawed a cinema from first category, but now there's another problem - which movie? You can either pick yourself or draw it again. This draw should only exist when first category had "cinema" and not anything else. You can add conditionals to your categories. Here for example you would choose "draw only when" -> category1 = "cinema".
